The application is developed using C++ with a focus on structured programming principles. It employs the following techniques:
1.	Structured Design: The use of struct data structures and functions helps encapsulate related data and operations, making the code modular and easier to understand. By organizing tasks into functions, the program maintains a clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability.
2.	Dynamic Array (Vector) Data Structure: The std::vector data structure is used to dynamically store products and customer information. This allows for efficient storage and resizing, making it suitable for handling an undefined number of entries without requiring fixed-size arrays.
3.	Basic User Input and Data Validation: The program uses basic input operations to gather data from users and validates their choices to prevent errors. For example, when adding or updating products, it checks if the product already exists in the inventory, ensuring accurate quantity updates and preventing duplicate entries.
4.	Simple Menu-Driven Interface: A while loop with a switch statement creates a simple, interactive menu, allowing users to choose operations like adding products, updating quantities, and displaying records. This provides an intuitive interface for users and ensures continuous interaction until they choose to exit.
